# Blockchain
It is a simple example for Blockchain Cryptocurrency

This example uses hashing functions for hashing transactions and it is done by using Node.js and typescript by Muzaffar Tursunbaev and Tilek Kenzhaev. We were interested in blockchain so while we did our research we found great exaple that helped us understand many concepts of data structures as well. We chose blockchain because in the past we have written "Research proposal on cyber security where i have discussed the importance of blockchain ,"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349848233_Improving_the_Knowledge_About_Cyber_Security_by_Using_Challenge_Based_Learning_Method"

We found this video "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF7dkrce-mQ" that we decided to use their code as our project for learning purposes and it was indeed helpful.
